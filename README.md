# Letters-in-alphabetical-order
You enter a word or a sentence and the code will sort all the signs in the alphabetical order. 1. special signs 2. numbers 3. letters

For example: 
Input = ["Alphabet 321..."]

Output = ["...123aabehlpt"] (spaces will be ignored)

And I just want to clearify that my codes aren't anything special I just upload them for fun and I use github as a cloud for my codes to never lose them :) HAVE A NÄ°CE DAY
